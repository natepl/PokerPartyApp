# PokerParty

Currently unavailable/in development

The PokerParty app isn't a poker app. Rather, it will allow users to create "Parties" of friends for poker games to keep track of how well each person is doing and to organize games. You can use the app to create tournaments or just a casual league. Users can see recent results and posts by their friends.
